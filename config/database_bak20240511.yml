  # As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
  # like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
  # ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
  #
  # Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
  # variable when you boot the app. For example:
  #
  #   DATABASE_URL="sqlserver://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
  #
  # If the connection URL is provided in the special DATABASE_URL environment
  # variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
  # the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
  # URL environment variable explicitly:
  #
  #   production:
  #     url: <%= ENV["MY_APP_DATABASE_URL"] %>
  #
  # Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
  # for a full overview on how database connection configuration can be specified.
