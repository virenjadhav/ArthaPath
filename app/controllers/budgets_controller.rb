#   but what if i changed the function name like index to list_all or list_all_budget and show to show_all or show_all_budgets so how is my redirect_to look like?

# If you change the action names in your BudgetsController, you'll need to update your redirect_to calls to reflect these new action names. The redirect_to method generates URLs based on the action names and the routing definitions, so you'll need to ensure that it points to the correct routes.

# Example with Renamed Actions
# Let's say you renamed your actions as follows:

# index to list_all or list_all_budgets
# show to show_all or show_all_budgets
# Here's how you would adjust the redirect_to calls in your controller:

# 1. Updated destroy Action
# Old Code:

# ruby
# Copy code
# def destroy
#   @budget.destroy
#   redirect_to budgets_url, notice: 'Budget was successfully destroyed.'
# end
# Updated Code (if you renamed index to list_all_budgets):

# ruby
# Copy code
# def destroy
#   @budget.destroy
#   redirect_to list_all_budgets_url, notice: 'Budget was successfully destroyed.'
# end
# Updated Code (if you renamed index to list_all):

# ruby
# Copy code
# def destroy
#   @budget.destroy
#   redirect_to list_all_url, notice: 'Budget was successfully destroyed.'
# end
# 2. Updated create and update Actions
# Old Code:

# ruby
# Copy code
# def create
#   @budget = Budget.new(budget_params)
#   if @budget.save
#     redirect_to @budget, notice: 'Budget was successfully created.'
#   else
#     render :new
#   end
# end

# def update
#   if @budget.update(budget_params)
#     redirect_to @budget, notice: 'Budget was successfully updated.'
#   else
#     render :edit
#   end
# end
# Updated Code (if you renamed show to show_all_budgets):

# ruby
# Copy code
# def create
#   @budget = Budget.new(budget_params)
#   if @budget.save
#     redirect_to show_all_budgets_url(@budget), notice: 'Budget was successfully created.'
#   else
#     render :new
#   end
# end

# def update
#   if @budget.update(budget_params)
#     redirect_to show_all_budgets_url(@budget), notice: 'Budget was successfully updated.'
#   else
#     render :edit
#   end
# end
# Updated Code (if you renamed show to show_all):

# ruby
# Copy code
# def create
#   @budget = Budget.new(budget_params)
#   if @budget.save
#     redirect_to show_all_url(@budget), notice: 'Budget was successfully created.'
#   else
#     render :new
#   end
# end

# def update
#   if @budget.update(budget_params)
#     redirect_to show_all_url(@budget), notice: 'Budget was successfully updated.'
#   else
#     render :edit
#   end
# end
# Updating Routes
# You'll also need to ensure your config/routes.rb file reflects the new action names. For example:

# ruby
# Copy code
# Rails.application.routes.draw do
#   resources :budgets, only: [:list_all, :show_all, :new, :create, :edit, :update, :destroy], path_names: { index: 'list_all', show: 'show_all' }
# end
# In this example, the path_names option is used to map the index action to list_all and the show action to show_all.

# Summary
# Change redirect_to Calls: Update redirect_to calls to match the new action names.
# Update Routes: Ensure your routes are updated to handle the new action names.
# Consistent Naming: Make sure that the renamed actions are reflected consistently in both your controller and routes to avoid routing errors.
# # By making these changes, you ensure that your applicationâ€™s URLs and redirects align with the new action names, preserving the correct navigation flow.
